Original Note by Diaper-Author, left as Reference to his work. OUTDATED INFORMATION:

This mod adds non-functioning diapers (basically just textures with buffs) to RimWorld.
Wearing diapers gives the pawn primarily social disadvantages.
But on the upside they grant alot of comfort and slightly decreases the risk of mental break.

Good-to-know/Bugs:
-I modelled these diapers after the humans of the "RimNude2.2.10 unofficial" texture pack. So they probably won’t fit well on any other beings/creatures.
-Rjw adds a small pregnancy bulge on female colonists. And if that happens then these diapers will clip out slightly. I’m not an expert on rjw’s code so I don’t know how to fix it.
-Assembly code ripped/edited from someone called "Project 06" on the ludeon forums. And from the UnderWhere mod by "An Ol' Spicy Keychain".
-Feel free to add/change/tweak/re-upload anything in this mod. No need to credit me.
